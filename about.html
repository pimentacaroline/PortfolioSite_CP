            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <h3>A videographer and a UX designer walk into a bar</h3>
            <p>
              My story starts in Brasil, where I was born and grew up. After finishing
              high school, I moved to Portugal, seeking better life opportunities. In Portugal, I
              worked for nine years as a saleswoman in a mall, where I learned a lot about
              people's needs and behaviors. Meanwhile, I studied Communication Science at
              Lisbon University, which opened the door for my first professional transition. Right
              after my graduation, I worked as a journalist in a TV program, and two years later, I
              launched myself as a videographer freelancer. As I use to say, being a videographer
              is a “one-woman show”. I was responsible for prospecting and relating with my
              clients, produce the videos (scriptwriting, shooting, interview, and edit), and when
              the "show" was too big, assembling and coordinating a team of coworkers. The
              videos that I produced in the last ten years, were mainly small documentaries about
              social innovation projects. Yes, I know, filming weddings are much more profitable,
              but my heart was always in Human Development subjects.
            </p>
            <p>
              Coming back to our plot… the videographer is already at the “bar” and now will
              enter the UX Designer.
              So one day I was looking for remote work in a platform, and vacancies for UX
              designer was popping up all the time. UX Designer? What is that? It took only 3
              hours reading about it to be sure that I found the perfect glove for my "professional
              being". I felt instantly attracted by the variety of disciplines, tools, and
              methodologies involved in the UX Design process. Still, mainly, I fell in love because
              it has humans at its core. I felt the call for another career change and found the
              perfect course at CareerFoundry. In one year, I got here, a freshly baked Ux
              Designer.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you walked into the bar right now, you would see not just the videographer and
              the UX Designer, but also a shy wanderlust woman that traveled less than she
              wanted, an uninhibited Forró's dancer, the most awkward person at funerals, and
              the weirdo that can’t close a book after starting it because she needs to know how
              it ends (by the way, I strongly believe that curiosity, somehow, will be my cause of
              death).
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for getting here. I love to hear other’s people stories, so please, get and
              touch and let’s talk.
